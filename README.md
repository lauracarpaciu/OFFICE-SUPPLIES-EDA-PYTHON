# Store-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

I applied some steps for this EDA like:

- read the dataset with pandasÂ ;

- viewing data, obtaining information such as entry number, column name, non-null, row count, and dtypes;

- obtain some dataset statistics and sort the data;

- Make some selections: Get the relevant columns for EDA by sorting the data set and selecting by column name;

- filtering datasets with boolean expressions and pandas methods like "isin()" for filtering;

- apply some operations such as mean, value count, and aggregate functions such as min, max, and sum;

- apply groupby, and pivot tables to demonstrate the relationship between relevant columns;
